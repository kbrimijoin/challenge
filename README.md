# InVisionApp Challenge

### Workflow tools for building a static website

- jQuery
- Less
- Bootstrap for responsive grid classes only

### Installation

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```


### Challenge Description

#### Requirements

At a minimum, we’d like to see the following screens implemented:

The initial page
The modal window (click on the chat icon at top to show)
The Settings page (accessible from under the profile photo)
You are free to build out other pages indicated in the prototype, but these are not required.

The end product should:

Be built in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
Be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 9
Not rely on HTML/CSS frameworks; while their use is not prohibited, the markup should be as clean and free of unnecessary elements
Be responsive
Be as faithful to the design and functionality demonstrated in the InVision prototype as practical
Guidelines

This is a front-end development demonstration only; no back-end or data persistence is required
You are free to demonstrate any improvement on the design as you’d like, but we ask that you do so in a separate copy of the project.

Delivery

Upon completion of the project, please provide

A link to download the source code, along with any instructions to run the app locally
